# Silverstripe SS Template Engine

The template parsing code from [silverstripe/framework](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework), refactored into its own separate module. This is the first step to allowing developers to natively use whatever templating engine best suits their project.

The code in this repository will eventually be refactored, which will necessarily require breaking changes in framework to work correctly. It is an experiment primarily intended for my own learning - but if you want to play around with it as well you'll need to use the `experimental-view-refactor` branch in [my fork of silverstripe/framework](https://github.com/GuySartorelli/silverstripe-framework/tree/experimental-view-refactor).
